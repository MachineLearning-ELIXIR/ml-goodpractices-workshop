## Description

Large amounts of biological data are continuously created, processed and transformed. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have become one of the preferred approaches for data processing and understanding given their capacity to deal with large amounts of data. In Life Sciences, ML is used in a variety of fields with the potential of resulting in ground-breaking medical applications. However, there are some issues around reproducibility, transparency, explainability and so on that could, at least partially, be alleviated by consistently applying good practices reflected in good descriptions and documentation wrt the ML model. This workshop/SIG deals with good practices, guidelines and metadata for FAIR, reproducible and transparent ML in Life Sciences. In this first edition, we will focus on the [Data, Optimization, Model and Evaluation (DOME) recommendations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01205-4) for supervised ML in biology which aim at facilitating the assessment of the quality and reliability of reported models.
